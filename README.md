**Console based cross platform firewall login client**

This is a cross platform portal client for sophos firewall made using [puppetteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer "puppetteer").

The default client does not support all architectures and Operating systems and hence this is a quick console based client to login from headless linux systems,raspberry pi's etc.

This client opens a real google chrome browser to login on console based systems without a GUI.

**Usage**

Just clone the repo and run "nodejs app.js"

If the architecture is not x86/x64, chrome binaries for that architecture need to be downloaded before use.
